    description:
      An identifier for the knowledge organization system used
      to classify the resource.  It is recommended that the
      identifier be a resolvable URI.  The list of schemes used
      in a searchable catalog can be determined by inspecting
      the server's OpenAPI document or, if the server implements
      CQL2, by exposing a queryable (e.g. named `scheme`) and
      enumerating the list of schemes in the queryable's schema
      definition.
