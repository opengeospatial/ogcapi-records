# OGC API (OAPI) Coverages Specification

This directory contains the OGC API Specification for Coverages. This specification, working with the parallel OGC API Common specification, defines the API analog to the WCS standard.

This Coverage specification addresses only those parts of an API which are specific to Coverage resources. Those capabilities which may have applicability beyond coverages should be considered for inclusion in Common.
