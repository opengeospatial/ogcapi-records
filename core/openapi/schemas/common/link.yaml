      This object contains one key per substitution variable in a templated
      href.  Each key defines the schema of one substitution variable using
      a JSON Schema fragment and can thus include things like the data type
      of the variable, enumerations, minimum values, maximum values, etc.
      In combination with a templated href, the variables section should
      provide enough information to bind to the target resource (e.g. a WMS).
