In the GeoJSON encoding of a record, the `time` member is a top level field.  Since some popular GeoJSON tools only manipulate record properties encoded in the `properties` section of a GeoJSON record, implementations MAY duplicate the `time` member from the top level into the `properties` section in order to take advantage of these available tools.
