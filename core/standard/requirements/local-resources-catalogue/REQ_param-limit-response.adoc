^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/local-resources-catalogue/param-limit-response*

^|A |The response SHALL not contain more resources from the local resources endpoint than specified by the optional `limit` parameter.
^|B |If the API definition specifies a maximum value for the `limit` parameter, the response SHALL not contain more resources from the local resources endpoint than this maximum value.
^|C |If the value of the `limit` parameter is larger than the maximum value, this SHALL NOT result in an error (instead use the maximum as the parameter value).
^|D |Only resources are counted that are on the first level of resources from the local resources endpoint. Any nested objects contained within the explicitly requested resources SHALL not be counted.
