^|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |*/req/json/record-response*
^|A |200-responses of the server SHALL support the following media type:

* `application/geo+json` for resources that include record content.

^|B |The `geometry` member SHALL store a geometry, for the purpose of discovery, of the resource being described by the record; this can be the actual geometry of the resource or some other representation of the space that the resource occupies.
