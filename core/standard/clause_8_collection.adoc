== Requirements Class "Record Collection"

[[record-collection-overview]]
=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_record-collection.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the requirements for a record collection.

A _collection_ is an object that provides information about and access to a set of related <<clause-core-record,records>>.  Such a collection of records is also referred to as a _catalogue_.

The schema for the collection resource is an extension of the collection schema defined in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#\_collection\_[OGC API - Features].

While http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html#\_collection\_[OGC API - Features] defines a specific location for the collection resource (path: `/collections/{collectionId}`), OGC API - Records only fixes the location of the collection in the <<clause-records-api,Record API>> conformance class.  Otherwise the collection resource can live anywhere the provider wishes to place it including as a static file in web space (e.g. a web-accessible directory or an S3 bucket).
