=== Overview

This annex describes common contact types when qualifying contact roles via a record contact's `roles` property, in the absence
of a formal controlled vocabulary.  Please note that these codelists and identifiers are NOT normative.  For information
communities wishing to formally identify and qualify, it is suggested that a specification extension be developed to meet those
requirements.
