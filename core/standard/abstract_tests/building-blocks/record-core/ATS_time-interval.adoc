//^|Test Method |. Construct a path for a given record that includes the `time` member.

//. Parse time object.
//. If the time object includes an `interval` member, check that each array item is a string that is a double-dot (`..`) or conforms to RFC 3339 (Date and Time on the Internet: Timestamps) and matches one of the following production rules: `full-date` (a date) or `date-time` (a timestamp)
//. If the start is a date, check that the end is a date, or `..`
//. If the start is a timestamp, check that the end is a timestamp or `..`
