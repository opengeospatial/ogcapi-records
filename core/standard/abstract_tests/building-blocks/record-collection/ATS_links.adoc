//^|Test Method |. Construct a path for catalog object.

//. Parse all link objects.
//. Check that one link has a `rel` property with value of `self`.
//. Issue a HTTP GET request on the resulting path.
//. Validate that the content between both requests is equal.
//. Check if the catalog has alternative representations and check that it has links with `rel` property with value of `alternate`.
//. Issue a HTTP GET request on each resulting path.
//. Validate that the retrieved content satisfies the asserted media type of the alternate representation.
