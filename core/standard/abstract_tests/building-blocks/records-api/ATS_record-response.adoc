//^|*Abstract Test {counter:ats-id}* |*/conf/records-api/record-response*
//^|Test Purpose |Validate a record response from the API.
//^|Requirement |<<req_records-api_record-response,/req/records-api/record-response>>
//^|Test Method |. Construct a path (`/collections/{catalogId}/items/{recordId}`) to retrieve records from a catalog.
//. Issue an HTTP GET request on that path and negotiate a GeoJSON (accept: `application/geo+json application=ogc-record`) response.
//. Check that the value of the returned HTTP status header is +200+.
//. Validate that the value of the `Content-Type` HTTP header is `application/geo+json application=ogc-record`.
//. Validate the content of the response using the schema https://schemas.opengis.net/ogcapi/records/part1/1.0/openapi/schemas/recordGeoJSON.yaml[recordGeoJSON.yaml].
//. Verify that all links in the `links` section include a `rel` parameter.
//. Check that the `links` section of the record contains the following links:
//* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
//* a typed link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`), and
//* a link to the catalog that contains this record (relation: `collection`).
