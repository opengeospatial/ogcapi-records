== Media Types

See https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-004r1/20-004r1.html#media-types-section[OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core, Media Types].

The media types for the CREATE, REPLACE and UPDATE requests as well as for the schema documents depend on the representations of the resources.

For GeoJSON features,

- CREATE and REPLACE operations will use `application/geo+json`,
- UPDATE operations will use `application/merge-patch+json`,
- schema documents will use `application/schema+json`.
