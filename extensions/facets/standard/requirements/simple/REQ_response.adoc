^|A |A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with an HTTP status code of 200.
^|B |For responses that use `application/schema+json` as the `Content-Type` of the response, the response SHALL have the following characteristics:

* The response contains an `id` (the identifier of the collection).
* The response contains a `facets` object, and each property is a facet definition object.
* Each facet definition object is a named object with:
** a `type` property identifying a `term`, `histogram`, or `filter` facet.
** a `property` property identifying the property name on which the facet will be computed against.
** a `sortedBy` property indicating whether buckets for that facet will be sorted by `value` or `count` (number of occurrences)
* Facets of type `term` contain the following additional properties:
** a `minimumOccurrenceCount` indicating the cutoff number of occurrence below which buckets will not be reported in this facet
* Facets of type `bucket` contain the following additional properties:
** a `bucketType` property indicating whether buckets are computed using fixed intervales (`fixedInterval`) or a fixed amount of resulting buckets (`fixedBucketCount`)
* Facets of type `filter` contain the following additional properties:
** a `filters` property containing a dictionary:
*** each entry in this dictionary will result in exactly one bucket for this facet
*** the key of the entry will be the `value` of the corresponding bucket in the facet result
*** the value of the entry is the search filter used to compute the bucket
