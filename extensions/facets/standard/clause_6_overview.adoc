== Overview

A **facet** refers to a high-level piece of information that is computed over a set of records in a given collection.  A facet differs from a search; it is used as a means to provide a better understanding of the composition of search results, and aids the users to refine and narrow their search.

A useful function of facets is to allow users to "drill-down" on the values they report, thus offering an easy way to refine a search request and narrow down results. This is done by advertising to the client which property was used to compute the facet; by combining the property and desired value, a new search filter can be produced by the client.

A facet can be represented by several mechanisms, as described below.

=== Term facet

A term facet can be applied to any text property and produces a list of unique values appearing for a specific property across all matching records, as well as the count of records containing each value.

==== Example

A common use case for a term facet involves identifying results by organizations.  A term facet applied against a `properties.contacts[].organization` property would provide a term facet list per below:

* "Meteorological Service of Canada" (52 records)
* "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration" (45 records)
* "UK Met Office" (33 records)

A catalogue may also return a search result of records containing properties describing the country of origin of a given resource.  A term facet computed over a `properties.country` property would return a list of buckets as follows:

* "Canada" (36 records)
* "Greece" (24 records)
* "Germany" (12 records)
* "England" (5 records)

=== Histogram facet

A histogram facet can be applied to any temporal or numeric property to indicate distribution of unique values over ranges or intervals.

==== Example

A catalogue may return search results with a histogram facet applied against `properties.created` as follows:

* "2020-01-01 to 2020-02-01" (18 records)
* "2020-02-01 to 2020-03-01" (22 records)
* "2020-03-01 to 2020-04-01" (43 records)

=== Filter facet

A filter facet produces a count of matching records for one or more predefined queries, and enables subsequent queries against a catalogue of records.

==== Example

A catalogue may return a filter facet that delineates search results by service type.

- "Download service" returns the amount of records which have at least 1 distribution of a download type (CSV, Excel...):
- "Visualization service" returns the amount of records which have at least 1 distribution of a map service type (WMS, WMTS...):

* "Download service" (300 records)
* "Visualization service" (243 records)
* "Subsetting service" (35 records)
