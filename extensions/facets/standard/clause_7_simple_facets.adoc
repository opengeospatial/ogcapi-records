== Requirements Class "Simple Facets"

include::requirements/requirements_class_simple.adoc[]

This requirements class defines the Facets resource for discovering a list of resource properties onto which facets are applicable and may be computed on.

In addition, a publisher may want to support facets that are not directly represented as resource properties in the content schema of the record.  Or the publisher may choose to restrict facets on certain properties, in support of managing high-performance queries and computations on a given metadata repository backend.

=== Extending queryables

As part of <<OAFeat-3, OGC API - Features - Part 3: Filtering>>, a queryables response can optionally advertise whether a facet can be produced for a given queryable using the `facet` boolean flag. This lets the client assess whether to invoke or skip a facets request.

=== Extending search results

As part of <<OARec-1, OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core>>, a catalogue query response might include a facet overview for any search result.  For example, given a query to:

[source,bash]
----
GET /collections/wis2-discovery-metadata/items
----

The response includes a `facets` object. The content represents an object of all facets available for that response, each containing various buckets describing different facets of the search result.  A facet is identified by a property identifier and contains the top number of buckets with their respective count. A bucket is a number of results in the result set matching the property.  The facets object may also indicate if additional buckets were omitted in order to keep the response size low via the `more` boolean property.

            "buckets": [
                {
                    "value": "Environment",
                    "count": "202"
                },
                {
                    "value": "Atmosphere",
                    "count": "150"
                },
                {
                    "value": "Open-data",
                    "count": "47"
                }
            ],
            "more": false
        },
        "created": {
            "type": "histogram",
            "property": "created",
            "buckets": [
                {
                    "min": "2010-01-01",
                    "max": "2011-01-01",
                    "count": 100
                },
                {
                    "min": "2011-01-01",
                    "max": "2012-01-01",
                    "count": 220
                }
            ],
            "more": true
        }
    },
    "features": [],
    "numberMatched": 375,
    "numberReturned": 0,
    "links": []
}

Note that in some situations, clients may be interested in the facets only.  In this case, a client can set a `limit` parameter of `0`.
