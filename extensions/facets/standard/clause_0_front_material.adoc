[big]*i.     Abstract*

The OGC API family of Standards is being developed to make it easy for anyone to provide geospatial data over the web. These Standards build upon the legacy of the OGC Web Service Standards (WMS, WFS, WCS, WPS, CSW, etc.), but define resource-centric APIs that take advantage of modern web development practices.

This document defines the OGC API - Records - Part 2: Facets Standard.  In this document "Records API" refers to the OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core Standard.

An implementation of a search API allows collections of records to be searched using logically connected spatial, temporal and scalar predicates.  As part of a given search response, additional information in the form of aggregations (facets) can provide enhanced navigation as well as valuable information about the spatio-temporal distribution of a given result set.

This Standard uses the https://docs.ogc.org/is/20-004r1/20-004r1.html[OGC API - Records - Part 1: Core] Standard for specifying requirements of Records search API faceting.
